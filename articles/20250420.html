		<p>Everyon is trying to convince you of something. Anything you read, anything you watch, or anything you listen to is packed full of things the author or speaker is trying to persuade you to do or think. Even I as I write this, though I am unpacking thoughts primaily, am trying to convince whoever may end up laying eyes on this that what I am saying is true. Or at the very least wanting you to open your mind to the idea of this being true.</p>
		<p>What are we to do with this?</p>
		<p>For one, if you are going to consume information, be sure and do it with your thinking cap on. Blindly consuming information with your guard down can be devestating.</p>
		<p>Deeper than this though, how should we approach the consumption of information?</p>
		<p>Think of information consumption the same way you would thinking about food consumption. It was Jesus himself who compared the word of God to bread. You are what you eat. This could also be applied to your mind. Your mind is shaped by what you saturate it with. If you watch the Kardashians on repeat when you get home from work, it won't be long until you begin behaving and thinking like a Kardashian. If you spend all of your free time consuming Star Wars, it won't be long until you start speaking like Yoda.</p>
		<p>We should take from this idea, that the majority of our information intake should come from the Bible. The Bible is the word of God and should be the main source of mental nutrients we intake.</p>
		<p>The Bible is like meat and potatoes.</p>
		<p>Christian literature and podcasts and such is like supplements that can help but should not be the main source of nutrients.</p>
		<p>Everything else (Podcasts, books, movies, etc.) is like junk food. Junk food is okay here and there but should be consumed sparingly lest we become mentally unhealthy.</p>
